## General info

A fully functional shopping cart implementation from scratch with local storage so the information persists across multiple pages. Populate the shop with items from a json file. The shopping cart shows/hides the items in it with a click. It updates the quantity of each item and calcultes the total price for each item and the grand total. Items can be removed from the shopping cart and the grand total is updated accordingly.
